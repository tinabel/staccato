# staccato
## A grid-based barebones and basic WordPress theme

Welcome! If you're reading this, you're probably wondering about Staccato and what it is. In musical terms, staccato is a style of playing short notes. This WordPress theme is short and sweet, just like a staccato note.

I wanted to create a theme that is easy to get in there and customize, so if you're looking to change colors, fonts, or anything else, the staccato.css file is a good place to start. This theme is css grid-based, so you won't see any floats or tables in here. 

Enjoy!
